# MobRacers.1.8.8
MobRacers for Spigot 1.8.8

I used INTELLIJ IDEA for this. I also put the core and mobracers together so it's easier to make changes. Just import this entire thing into the software and be sure to add the
CraftBukkit 1.8.8 jar and the Spigot 1.8.8 Shaded jar from BuildTools, and you should be good!
